This column can be used to group several images together If several images (e.g. fields, or replicate images) have been taken of the same sample then repeat the assay name on each row corresponding to the imaging file.  It can also be used to group raw and processed images from the same assay together"	"# add an experimental condition if there is one e.g. 'targeted protein', or 'antibody'"	# enter an identifier for any associated genes e.g. ensembl identifier for targeted protein	# enter gene symbol for any associated genes e.g. BRCA1	# any comments about the gene annotation e.g. what gene annotation build the gene identifiers come from	# the names of the channels and what was labeled in each channel	# this column can be used to group images into datasets.  These datasets will be used to group the images in the Image Data Resource.  The name can be the same as the assay name.	# the name of the image file	# the dimensions of the image # any comments about image files (can say its missing if you no longer have it)	# the path to the file  # is it a raw image or derived?	data analysis protocol	# name of the file with the results in
